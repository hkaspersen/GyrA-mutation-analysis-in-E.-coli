# E. coli gyrA mutation analysis

R script for mutation analysis of E. coli gyrA gene with .fasta files.
The script was written with R version 3.4.3 and R-Studio version 1.1.383.

The script is initially written to match .fasta files from the Sanger sequencing services from GATC Biotech (https://www.gatc-biotech.com/en/index.html).

The script can easily be changed to analyse another gene if desired by changing the reference file and frame_test_sequence, and also the filter() specifications in the resulting data frame.
